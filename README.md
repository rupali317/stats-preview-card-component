## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### Tested with

- [jest-dom Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom?tab=readme-ov-file) - provides a set of custom jest matchers that one can use to extend jest. These will make tests more declarative, clear to read and to maintain. As part of that goal, one wants to avoid all the repetitive patterns that arise in doing so. Checking for an element's attributes, its text content, its css classes, etc.
- Browsers used for testing: Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Brave, Microsoft Edge
- Devices: 
  - (Real) MacBook Pro (15 inch), Samsung Galaxy A33 5G, Samsung Galaxy S20+
  - (Virtual) The mobile and tablet devices mentioned under Chrome's dev console

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

- I used CSP in HTML http-equiv meta tags. In future projects, I wish to move the CSP to HTTP header. 
- For CSP, I have used 'unsafe-inline' even though I have not used inline styles in my project. Perhaps React is generating inline styles during runtime. I added the unsafe-inline otherwise the styles would not be applied. unsafe-inline was a quick fix but this is not a good practice since it is not safe against XSS. I would like to explore nonces or hashes to allow inline styles.
- I want to keep practising more test cases for testing UI styles by using jest-dom testing library.

### Useful resources

- [mix-blend-mode vs background-blend-mode](https://alistapart.com/article/blending-modes-demystified/) - This blog differentiates on when the above properties are used.
- [Section vs Article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/07/article-section-elements-accessibility/) - This blog illustrates the use cases on when to use section tag vs article tag. I was impressed by the detailed examples.
- [Picture element](https://fedmentor.dev/posts/html-plan-product-preview/#product-image) - This blog introduced me to the usage of picture element and its benefits about having good performance and letting us write cleaner and maintainable code.
